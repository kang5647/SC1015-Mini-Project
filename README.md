# SC1015  Mini Project - _League of Legends_
![image](frontpage.jpg)
## About
This is a project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on predicting the win rate in the game League of Legends using the data of the state of the game in the early game (first 15 minutes). For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in the [Jupyter Notebooks](/Jupyter_notebooks) folder in order from: 
### 1. Data Analysis 
_The code might not be rendered in github as the filesize is large for the two files_
1. [Data_Analysis_part1.ipynb](Data_Analysis_part1.ipynb)
2. [Data_Analysis_part2.ipynb](Data_Analysis_part2.ipynb)
\
\
Require [match_15m.csv](data/match_15m.csv) and [match_full_time.csv](data/match_full_time.csv). We separate Data Analysis into 2 parts as a single notebook is too big  to be uploaded onto github. The code in the notebooks are used to analyze the 
 **macro decisions** against **win rate** in the first 15 minutes of the match. Each analysis is done by **tiers** to see if players in different tiers vary in decision-making and playstyle. Some **data cleaning** and **feature engineering** is done for the analysis. **Plotly** is used to visualize the data. 
### 2. [Data Cleaning](/Jupyter_notebooks/Data_Cleaning.ipynb)  
   Require [match_15m.csv](data/match_15m.csv) and [match_full_time.csv](data/match_full_time.csv). This notebook is used to **combine all the data 
   cleanings** (including those from Data Analysis) to generate a cleaned data csv file for our model training.  
### 3. [Machine Learning](/Jupyter_notebooks/Model_training.ipynb)  
   Require [blueTeam_cleaned_data.csv](data/blueTeam_cleaned_data.csv). This notebook is used to perform **machine learning** on the cleaned dataset. We use 
   [Logistic Regression](https://pythonfordatascienceorg.wordpress.com/logistic-regression-python/) function to create 2 models - one with the **number of dragon takedowns**, the other with the **specific types of dragons being killed**. We then compare the outcome of the models to see how each feature affect the outcome of the game
## Problem Statement
> **_Given the 15-minute dataset: Estimate the Chances of Winning the Game based on the Macro Decisions_**
## Model used 
* Logistic Regression 
## Conclusion 
* Players in all tiers **value objectives** that could bring **more gold difference**, i.e. **Towers**, **Kills**, **First Blood**, **First Tower**
* In higher tier, players value the **number** of each objective taken more than the **first** of every objective
* **Any** type of dragons secured **add** to the probability of **winning** the game
## What Did We Learn from this Project?
1. Understanding and Applying a Different **Machine Learning** Tool for our Project
      * E.g. **Logistic Regression** and its **Assumptions** to be Met to have a **Effective Model**
2. Applying a Different **Visualization** Tool 
      * **Plotly** (Refer to the notebook for the interaction with Plotly charts)
## Slides
* A copy of our [video presentation slides](SC1015_LeagueOfLegends.pptx) is included in the repository.
